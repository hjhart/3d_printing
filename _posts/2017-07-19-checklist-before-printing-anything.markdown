Here is a guide of things I check each time I print. I still suck at this, and pretty much every one of my prints have failed in some way, but if you're looking to get started with your new printer &emdash; here is a good place to start.

This checklist should probably be printed right in front of my printer.

On second thought, perhaps it should be on a monitor right in front of my printer, since every time I print it I'll think of something to add to it.

* Export your model from Cura
* Load file into OctoPrint
* Set nozzle temperature 195 (for PLA, or other material temp)
* Retract the extruder about 10mm.
* Lift the nozzle up, clean it.
* Take off the [glass plate][glass_plate] from the printing bed.
* Scrape off any gunk that remained from any failed prints.
* Wipe down with some isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab
* After it is dry, spray the glass with some [hairspray][hairspray_link].
* Put the glass plate back on the heating bed.
* Heat up the bed to 60 (for PLA, or other material temp)
* Wait for the hairspray to dry off of the bed. Once it's done, you're ready for the next step.
* Is the printing bed level? Yes? Good. No? [Level it.][leveling_video]
* Click Print in OctoPrint
* Wait and watch your print gloriously fail!
