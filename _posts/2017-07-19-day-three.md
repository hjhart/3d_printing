# Day Three with the Monoprice Maker Select v2

OK!

So I am having some success with a new technique. A lot of variables changed.

I took off the buildtak surface from the aluminum bed. I [goof off][goof_off]'ed the shit out of the aluminum bed. Put the silicon thermal pad down, then the glass on top. Nice!

I think a problem still exists that I am not on a level surface where I am printing. That should be improved upon tomorrow.
