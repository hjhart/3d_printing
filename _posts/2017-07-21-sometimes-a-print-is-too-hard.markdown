I am giving up on [this print][paddle_boat]. It's too hard for my skills at this point, and I'm okay with it. There are so many other great prints to focus on, and I can come back to it later!

I've printed two of the three pieces, but not the paddle itself, and it is looking pretty good.

But I'm moving on to a low poly deer trophy, and I'm pretty excited to use the skills I've learned so far to the test. We'll see how it goes and what lessons I'll learn, including building supports for the first time.
