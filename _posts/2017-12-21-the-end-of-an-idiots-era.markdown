I'm all done. The printer I got was just a little too finicky. I had just a bit too little free time. I stopped finding things I liked to print. I didn't get into the customization part quickly enough. The learning curve was too high.

For those reasons and more, I'll be discontinuing this hobby.

Thanks for reading, everyone.
