# Day Two with the Monoprice Maker Select v2

Setting up OctoPi

https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md

Failed printing the hull of the ship. Decided retraction was a problem as was the small % of Infill. Trying again with a smaller model... Although, perhaps I should keep the size the same.

Also boosted initial layer speed up from 5 to 20.

Put initial layer speed back down to 10mm/s
