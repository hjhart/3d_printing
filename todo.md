Things for me to do to improve quality of prints:

* ~Remove the buildtak surface from the print bed with goof off~
* Make the printer surface physically level (depends on lack table being delivered)
* Detangles the wires
* [Mosfet modification][mosfet_mod]
* Z-Axis Modification
* Print out a toy for [Henry's bathtime][boats_boats_boats]
