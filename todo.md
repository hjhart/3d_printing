Things for me to do to improve quality of prints:

* [Mosfet modification][mosfet_mod]
* Remove the buildtak surface from the print bed with goof off
* ~~Make the printer surface physically level~~
* ~~Detangles the wire in the back~~
* ~~[Z-Brace Modification][zbrace_post]~~
* ~~Print out a toy for [Henry's bathtime][boats_boats_boats]~~
