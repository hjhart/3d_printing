Here is a guide of things I check each time I print. I still suck at this, and pretty much every one of my prints have failed in some way, but if you're looking to get started with your new printer &mdash; here is a good place to start.

1. Export your model from Cura
1. Load file into [OctoPrint][octoprint]
1. Lift the nozzle up 50mm.
1. Set nozzle temperature 195 (for PLA, or other material temp), and while waiting for it to get to temp...
1. Take off the [glass plate][glass] from the printing bed.
1. Scrape off any gunk that remained from any failed prints.
1. Spray your glass plate with some [isopropyl alcohol][isopropyl] in a spray bottle.
1. Wipe it off with a microfiber rag.
1. Spray the glass with some [hairspray][hairspray].
1. Once the nozzle is up to temp, retract the extruder 10mm.
1. Clean the nozzle with a thick rag, avoiding burns from the hot nozzle.
1. Put the glass plate back on the heating bed.
1. Heat up the bed to 50 (for PLA, or other material temp)
1. Swipe any more filament that may have leaked from the nozzle, now lower it.
1. Wait for the hairspray to dry off of the bed. Once it's done, you're ready for the next step.
1. Is the printing bed level? Yes? Good. No? [Level it.][leveling_video]
1. Click Print in OctoPrint
1. Wait and watch your print gloriously fail!
