Here is a guide of things I check each time I print. I still suck at this, and pretty much every one of my prints have failed in some way, but if you're looking to get started with your new printer &emdash; here is a good place to start.

This checklist should probably be printed right in front of my printer.

On second thought, perhaps it should be on a monitor right in front of my printer, since every time I print it I'll think of something to add to it.

1. Export your model from Cura
1. Load file into [OctoPrint][octoprint]
1. Lift the nozzle up 50mm.
1. Set nozzle temperature 195 (for PLA, or other material temp), and while waiting for it to get to temp...
1. Take off the [glass plate][glass] from the printing bed.
1. Scrape off any gunk that remained from any failed prints.
1. Wipe down with some [isopropyl alcohol][isopropyl] on a cotton swab
1. After it is dry, spray the glass with some [hairspray][hairspray].
1. Retract the extruder 5-10mm.
1. Now that the nozzle is at temp, clean it.
1. Put the glass plate back on the heating bed.
1. Heat up the bed to 50 (for PLA, or other material temp)
1. Swipe any more filament that may have come off the nozzle, now lower the nozzle.
1. Wait for the hairspray to dry off of the bed. Once it's done, you're ready for the next step.
1. Is the printing bed level? Yes? Good. No? [Level it.][leveling_video]
1. Click Print in OctoPrint
1. Wait and watch your print gloriously fail!
